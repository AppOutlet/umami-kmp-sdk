# Umami Kotlin SDK

> **Disclaimer:** This library is currently in active development. There is no stable or usable build available yet. Please check back later for updates or follow the repository for progress.

An unofficial, open-source library for Kotlin Multiplatform that makes it easy to interact with the [Umami](https://umami.is) web analytics REST API.

This SDK provides a type-safe, asynchronous wrapper, allowing you to integrate Umami's privacy-focused analytics into your Kotlin applications (Android, iOS, JVM, etc.) with minimal effort.

## What is Umami?

[Umami](https://umami.is) is a simple, fast, privacy-focused alternative to Google Analytics. It provides you with powerful web analytics while respecting user privacy and without collecting any personal information. This SDK helps you send data to your self-hosted or cloud-hosted Umami instance directly from your application.

## âœ¨ Features

* **Kotlin Multiplatform:** Write your analytics tracking logic once and share it across Android, iOS, JVM, and more.
* **Asynchronous:** Built with Kotlin Coroutines for non-blocking API calls.
* **Type-Safe:** Reduces the risk of errors when interacting with the Umami API.
* **Lightweight & Simple:** A clean API surface that is easy to understand and integrate.
